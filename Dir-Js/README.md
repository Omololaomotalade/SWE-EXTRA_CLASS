# Javascript training
Here was my attempt to master the basics of `JavaScript` programming, so as to develop the capacity to learn any framework of my choice that was built from it, such as; `node.js`, `Express.js`, `React.js`, `Angular`, `Vue` and any one of them that I may develop personal interest in.

This repository holds the codes that were written in live learning sessions and the assignments I did thereafter.
